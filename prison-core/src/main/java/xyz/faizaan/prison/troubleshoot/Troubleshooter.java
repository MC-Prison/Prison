/**
 * A Troubleshooter performs a maintenance routine for a common problem that a user may face.
 * Before registering a Troubleshooter, ask yourself if the problem can be avoided in your
 * design first. Troubleshooters add an extra task for the user which may hinder the user experience.
 * <p>
 * Troubleshooters are expected to safely perform fixes during runtime. A good example of where a
 * Troubleshooter can be applied is in the old ranking up bug in Prison 2, in which rank IDs would
 * corrupt and cause the same rank to be purchased repeatedly. A Troubleshooter could have set the
 * rank IDs manually at runtime.
